# HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactoring Project

>## My Task

  **Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does) in order to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology to practice common tasks for front-end and junior developers. For this particular assignment, I've refactored an existing site to make it more accessible as well as making the code itself easier to read. 


  I've also improved the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, I've checked that all links are functioning correctly. I've also increased the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before certain elements or sections of the page where organizational changes were made.


>## Code Style & Tech/Framework Used

  For this project, I've utilized Visual Studio Code in order to edit the webpage's html and css attributes and implement these changes.


>## Demo

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)


>## Acceptance Criteria

  I've utilized the following criteria in order to meet html semantic standards and properly consolidate CSS code in order to increase efficiency and functionality.

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
