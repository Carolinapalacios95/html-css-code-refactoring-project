# HTML & CSS: Code Refactoring Project

>## My Task

  **Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does) in order to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology to practice common tasks for front-end and junior developers. For this particular assignment, I've refactored an existing site to make it more accessible as well as making the code itself easier to read. In addition, in order to increase efficiency and functionality, I've met html semantic standards and properly consolidated the CSS code.


>## Code Style & Tech/Framework Used

  For this project, I've utilized Visual Studio Code in order to edit the webpage's html and css attributes and implement these changes.


>## Demo

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

>## Features

* Improved the codebase for long-term sustainability by checking that all links are functioning correctly. 

* Added alt attributes to all the links on the page in order to make the site more accessible.

* Increased the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and included comments before certain elements or sections of the page where organizational changes were made.
